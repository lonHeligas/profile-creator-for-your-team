// *    Start
// *    Start the questions
// *         ask information for the manger
// *            set manager status

// *         branch to engineer employee or intern employee
// *         Add first employee
// *         branch to engineer employee or intern employee

// *         branch to engineer
// *           ask questions
// *           add to engineer array
// *           ask if the user wants to add another employee 
// *           return if yes

// *         branch to intern
// *           ask questions
// *           add to intern array
// *           ask if the user wants to add anoter employee 
// *           return if yes

// *         if no, ask for filename
// *         build out html in this order:
// *              manager, engineers, interns
// *         make sure the css is set for this as well (bootstrap?)


// *         <end of line>

// ? put it all together in a team? like :
// ? const myCompany = new Company("Acme Travel", destinations, customers);
// ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
// ? const theTeam = new Team(teamName, Manager, Employees) 

// ? and then when it's time to spit out the info into the HTML, we use the team.teamName, team.Manager(information), Employees(is an array of information)

// ! the getDestination method from Gary's example may be a good launching point for the building of the html page
